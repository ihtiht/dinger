1. Fork the repository.
2. Create your feature branch.
3. Commit your changes.
4. Push the branch to your fork.
5. Create a new pull request on the repository with your branch.

Note that, if approved, your pull request may have to be closed and 
re-opened by a contributor with write access due to CI restrictions, 
but once merged you will still figure as author of the commits 
nevertheless.
